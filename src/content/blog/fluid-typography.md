Typography is one of the most important aspects of web design, and fluid typography takes it to the next level. Instead of fixed font sizes that jump at breakpoints, fluid typography scales smoothly with the viewport.

## How It Works

Fluid typography uses CSS clamp() to create a responsive scaling between minimum and maximum font sizes. This creates a more natural reading experience across different device sizes.

```css
font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.5rem + 1vw, 1.5rem);
```

This approach ensures that text remains readable on mobile devices while taking advantage of larger screens when available.
