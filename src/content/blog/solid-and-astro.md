Astro's component islands architecture pairs beautifully with SolidJS. While Astro handles static content and routing, SolidJS provides the perfect solution for interactive components.

## Benefits of This Combination

1. **Performance First**: Astro's zero-JS-by-default approach means pages load fast
2. **Interactive When Needed**: SolidJS components only hydrate when necessary
3. **Developer Experience**: Both frameworks prioritize simplicity and developer happiness

This combination gives us the best of both worlds - blazing fast static content with the power to add interactivity where it matters.
