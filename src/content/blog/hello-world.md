Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post using Astro's content collections. I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and projects with you all.

## Why Astro?

Astro is an amazing framework that allows me to build fast, content-focused websites. With features like:

- Content Collections
- Markdown/MDX support
- Fluid Typography
- SolidJS Integration

I can focus on writing while maintaining the flexibility to add interactive components when needed.

Stay tuned for more posts!
